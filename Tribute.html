<p>&nbsp;  <b>So I was meant to write a tribute to someone I admire so much and I thought,</b><i> " Why not write about myself"</i></p>
<p>Here's a few things you should know about me</p>
<ol>
    <li>I love music and singing, ps: I am a big fan of Naira Marley's songs.</li>
<li>I have 5 awesome siblings which includes only one sister.<br>The love I have for my siblings is like that of a mother because I actually took care of those kids.  </li>
<li>I love to hangout with friends and have fun</li>
<li>I am a really nice person although I can be mean sometimes</li>
<li>I don't get angry easily but you don't want to see me angry</li>
<li>I get upset at little things like when people do not keep to their words</li>
<li>I love wearing gowns ; they are so easy to slip on</li>
<li>I love helping out and volunteering when I have the chance to</li>
<li>I like to look good everytime but I don't like people staring at me</li>
<li>I love sleeping and that is because sleep has become a way of escape for me; everything seems better when I sleep and wake up.</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;  Now, I am sure you are wondering why I wrote a tribute to myself. It's because there's no other person I know so much about other than myself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;  Lastly, I admire myself for standing tall and proud no matter what life throws at me. </p>
